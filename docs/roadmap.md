# Roadmap

What's explicitly deferred, and the suggested order of next steps.

## Explicitly deferred

Things we have noted but consciously not designed yet:

- **Packaging the corpus for distribution.** The whole project runs from a
  checkout: every `.cardlang` is loaded from `docs/games/` by repo-relative path
  (tests, CLI, and the OpenSpiel adapter's `hearts_game()` loader), and the
  corpus *is* the living spec (`docs/games/` per CLAUDE.md). A wheel install
  ships only `cardlang*` + the grammar, so `docs/games/*.cardlang` would be
  absent and any runtime that parses a corpus file would fail. This only matters
  once the project is distributed as a wheel (not a current goal); the fix is a
  project-level decision — ship the corpus as package data and load it via
  `importlib.resources` — not an adapter-local patch (patching only the adapter
  while the rest stays checkout-relative would be inconsistent). Flagged by
  Codex on the OpenSpiel-adapter PR.

- **CCG-style card effects** (Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh!). Out of initial scope. The
  Forge text-DSL pattern (one mini-language per card) is the reference if/when
  we tackle this.

- **Detailed melding logic.** Pinochle's meld phase is a flat Counter-based
  tally (`pinochle_meld_value`, a game-local stdlib primitive — the DSL body
  itself is fully migrated). Real melding as a reusable combination model
  (shared conflict resolution across arbitrary meld categories, not just the
  one hand-picked trump-run-subsumes-marriage overlap) is its own design
  exercise.

- **Grammar surface deferred by the checker.** Grammatically valid forms are
  statically rejected until a game needs them (decisions.md "Surface
  totality": rejected loudly rather than silently ignored). Movements: the
  `in <zone>` form (the verb implying its destination — `muck one cards in
  discard`), the per-movement `visibility =` override (visibility derives from
  the declared zone types; the override's semantics is
  [open-questions/move-level-visibility.md](open-questions/move-level-visibility.md)),
  and resource movements (`move 2 chips …` — the corpus keeps chips/coins as
  Integer state; moving resources through zones is undesigned). Elsewhere:
  `override` rule deltas in `active_rules:`, `before_each`/`after_each` on a
  phase with no iteration, transition events other than `play_to_trick`, a
  trick round naming a move type its form cannot run, and duplicate
  `state { }` blocks. Rules that the runtime cannot yet enforce at all are a
  named open question, not a rejection —
  [open-questions/rule-scope-beyond-trick-play.md](open-questions/rule-scope-beyond-trick-play.md).

- **Solitaire and positional zones.** CardStock excludes spatially-dependent
  layouts. We don't, but we haven't implemented one yet. Klondike or FreeCell
  will be the test case.

- **OpenSpiel compilation (general pass).** A per-game *runtime adapter* now
  validates the target: Hearts is a registered `pyspiel.Game` passing OpenSpiel's
  consistency tester (see decisions.md "OpenSpiel compilation"). What remains is
  the general, all-corpus path: a game-agnostic action/information-state encoder
  (the Hearts adapter's encoder is hand-written), explicit per-deal chance nodes
  (the adapter fixes a deal from a finite seed set), performance (the adapter
  re-simulates per query — O(n²); a real pass or a snapshot/restore path removes
  it). Every corpus game is registered — no concrete mechanics remain.

- **Auto-derivation of `information_state_tensor`.** This is the prize for
  OpenSpiel integration but depends on zone visibility being airtight. The Hearts
  adapter provides information-state *strings* only; tensors are deferred.

- **Grow the interactive-decision kernel and migrate the corpus to it.** `offer`
  and the `round` construct are built, and every trick game (Hearts, Spades,
  Getaway, Bridge, Oh Hell) now plays on the kernel `round` — the built-in `Trick`
  mechanic is retired, with `round` carrying rule-delta transitions (Hearts/Spades)
  and early-termination (Getaway). The rest of the decision sublanguage
  (decisions.md "Interactive decisions: a kernel and an in-DSL standard library")
  is the major in-flight work: the remaining `round` axes (accumulator, order,
  move vocabulary); typed outcomes and definition-composition; and promoting
  shared `auction` / `betting` / `challenge` / `block` definitions to the
  standard library at their third instances. The corpus migration itself is
  COMPLETE: every game runs on the kernel, no per-game runtime mechanic
  remains, and the `instantiate` construct is deleted. The recorded next
  scope of work is upgrading the migrated random-play reductions to real
  decisions (Coup's interactive response windows and targets; Tichu's call
  windows) — behaviour changes with their own sign-offs, in
  [kernel-migration.md](kernel-migration.md), Workstream 5.

- **Typed outcomes: Stages 1–3 built; remaining corpus migrations + checker coverage.**
  Stage 1 is built: `cardlang/typecheck.py` is a real type checker (a `Type`
  model, expression inference, and checks for assignment compatibility, stdlib
  argument types, subscript legality, and Boolean conditions — the
  `decisions.md` "Typed object model" subset, with the corpus as its test net).
  **Stage 2 is built:** user-defined `type` structs (`TStruct`: declared fields,
  `derived` fields, field-access typing, construction via `Name { … }`, and
  runtime struct values) and param-light `define` variant outcomes (`TVariant`:
  `produce` / `produces:` with exhaustiveness, payload typing, and scoped
  payload-binder typing), running end to end through the tree-walking runtime.
  **Stage 3 is built:** phase `→ outcome { … }` + `produces:` on phases (an
  auction round raises the same `_ProduceSignal`, adopted
  by its enclosing outcome-declaring phase), the imperative arm vocabulary
  `continue to <phase>` / `skip to next hand`, and nullable variant payload types
  (`Suit?`) — reusing the Stage-2 `produces:` consumer and `TVariant`
  (`decisions.md` "Typed phase outcomes"). **Bridge** (auction:
  `contract_finalized | all_pass`) and **Schnapsen** (settlement: `claimed |
  talon_closed | open_play`) are migrated off their Boolean gates onto it.

  The remaining typed-outcome migrations stay deferred because their decision is
  not at a clean DSL/mechanic boundary (Pinochle's own `declare_trump` decision
  cleared this bar — it is now a
  plain one-draw DSL round, no typed outcome needed: `bid_abandoned` is an
  ordinary Boolean state var, like the games above it; **French Tarot**'s
  whole hand, not just its auction, cleared it too — the chien discard, the
  eighteen tricks, and the scoring are all plain DSL now, no typed outcome
  beyond the auction's own `taken | thrown_in`; **Skat** cleared it the same
  way — the Reizen threads `working_bid`/`passer` phase state and the scoring
  writes `score` directly, no typed outcome anywhere): **Getaway**'s two-way
  resolution now lives in its `round` body (`if state.trick_terminated_early`), so
  a typed outcome there would mean the `round` itself producing a tagged
  pickup-vs-discard result rather than the body branching on round state.

  Deferred from Stage 2: union-typed and refinement-typed struct fields
  (`suit : Suit | NT`, `Integer in 1..7`); param-full `define` (parameters +
  invocation-as-expression) until the challenge/block/auction stdlib reaches
  three corpus instances; forward references between struct types resolve to
  `TAny` (structs are built in source order). Struct literals are validated in
  statement position only — state-decl defaults are *not* expression-checked, so
  `deal : Contract = Contract { level: 1 }` (omitting a field) is accepted by the
  checker and fails only at runtime on field access.

  Deferred checker coverage (from Stage 1 review): BinOp operand compatibility
  (`hearts == 5` currently passes), movement `amount` must be Integer, rule
  `demands`/`applies_when` conditions, and constraining `loser.selection` to
  `Player`. Stage 2 types `produces:` arm binders (its scoped consumer walk), but
  the other binders — `for each` / lambda / comprehension / quantifier /
  player-query — still infer `TAny` today (deliberately, to avoid false
  positives), so binder-typed mistakes there are missed.

- **`scoring_component` / triggered components (runtime).** The design is settled
  (decisions.md "Scoring composition" and "Triggered scoring components"), but the
  corpus scores through inline statements plus game-local stdlib primitives, and
  the runtime has not built the
  component subsystem. Build it when a game needs cross-hand triggered scoring
  that inline computation can't express.

- **Representative playouts.** The runtime's random chooser exercises invariants
  but never reaches skill-gated branches (Spades' +500 win and bridge slams
  are implemented but unexercised). A light "rational-ish"
  policy plugged into the `chooser` seam would make playouts representative and
  surface bugs the conservation invariants structurally cannot.

- **`RuntimeState` config-into-constructor.** The driver sets ~ten config fields
  on the instance *after* construction, so an under-initialized state fails deep
  in evaluation rather than at construction. Deferred until a *second*
  construction site that doesn't go through `play_game` exists to design the shape
  against (required constructor kwargs vs a frozen `GameConfig`).

- **Test-depth regression nets.** Conservation invariants catch *leaks* but not
  *mis-allocation or wrong amounts*. Add independent-recompute checks when those
  games are next touched: Schnapsen's six-way settlement amount (1/2/3 game
  points — its kernel migration pinned the per-hand `game_score` vector golden, a
  characterization that localizes a divergence but does not independently
  recompute the tiers), Spades' nil and bag-overflow score branches, and Coup's
  challenge resolving to the correct loser. (The Bridge analogue — a full scoring
  recompute — is done.)

- **Determinization as a compiler pass.** For IS-MCTS support. Deferred.

- **Bidding sub-language.** Bridge bidding systems are a domain unto
  themselves. The current `submit_bid` move type is enough for Spades/Oh
  Hell/Pinochle-style bidding; Bridge will need more.

- **First-player / opening-seat syntax.** Coup is the first game whose
  opener is neither dealer-derived nor rule-derived — it's an arbitrary
  runtime seed. A dedicated way to specify the starting player
  (including programmatic randomization) is deferred until more such
  games arrive to show the shape. The turn-order start is
  runtime-supplied in the meantime (see library.md "Stdlib state").

- **The meta-DSL for "X is Y but with deltas".** We discussed this as the
  natural way the literature describes variants. The current design supports
  it implicitly (a variant adds/removes rules and phases from a base game)
  but doesn't have explicit syntax for it. Worth revisiting after Pinochle.

## Suggested next steps, in order

[open-questions/_index.md](open-questions/_index.md) orders the open
questions by impact × actionability and is the authority on question
priority. This section adds what that list doesn't carry: the cross-cutting
work that isn't an open question, and which next game unblocks what.

1. **Resolve [move-parameter-domains](open-questions/move-parameter-domains.md)
   (Tier 1 — ready now).** The bounded-`Integer` parameter/`choose` domain,
   the remainder after Rank/Player landed in decisions.md ("Declared
   parameter domains"); retires the `_MAX_CHOOSE` magic constant.

2. **Build the actionable-now information-partition checks.** From
   [open-questions/structural-infoset-proofs.md](open-questions/structural-infoset-proofs.md)
   ("Actionable now"): legal-action agreement, the seed/rng
   non-observability assertions, adapter agreement, and the enumerated
   per-visible-fact soundness perturbations — plus the witness-and-coverage
   reporting obligations. All buildable against today's swap-and-replay
   harness; none waits on that question's blocking data point. These close
   the certification gaps that make partition claims citable.

3. **The Workstream 5 chooser upgrade**
   ([kernel-migration.md](kernel-migration.md), Workstream 5's recorded
   scope boundary): upgrade Tichu's call windows and Coup's response
   windows, claimed characters, and targets from rng primitives to real
   player decisions. A behaviour change with new goldens and its own
   sign-off, not a migration. It changes what the information partition *is*
   for those two games — so it precedes any external partition claim — and
   its non-trick-shaped visibility (public challenge outcomes, a publicly
   revealed proof card, a private replacement draw) is a natural first
   exercise for step 2's checks.

4. **Pick the next game for its unblocks.** The full pipeline is
   [games/_candidates.md](games/_candidates.md); several candidates each
   unblock more than one open question:

   - **500 or Belote** — the unequally-observed phase outcome that
     [knowledge-events](open-questions/knowledge-events.md) awaits (500's
     open misère reveal; Belote's in-play declarations), and plausibly also
     the compound hidden-function probe that blocks
     [structural-infoset-proofs](open-questions/structural-infoset-proofs.md)'
     constructive world generator — one game, two unblocks.
   - **President** — the corpus-quality anchor
     [turn-loop-form](open-questions/turn-loop-form.md) is blocked on, and
     the third climbing instance that triggers promoting a shared
     combination model to the standard library.
   - **Gin Rummy** — the other turn-loop-form anchor, and the rummy-family
     game [meld-groups](open-questions/meld-groups.md) is blocked on.
   - **Doppelkopf** — a verified forcing function for both
     [zone-access-syntax](open-questions/zone-access-syntax.md) and
     [optional-window-moves](open-questions/optional-window-moves.md).
   - **Klondike or FreeCell** — first solitaire; forces the deferred
     positional-zone design rather than an open question.

5. **Address Tier 3 questions when their corner gets exercised.**
   [move-level-visibility](open-questions/move-level-visibility.md) awaits
   the first game needing a move-level projection override;
   [zone-access-syntax](open-questions/zone-access-syntax.md) awaits a
   complex relational chain in subject position (Doppelkopf, above). When
   these land, the step-2 checks are their acceptance bar: new visibility
   surface arrives with derived partition coverage, not bespoke tests.

6. **Pin down [memory-event-syntax](open-questions/memory-event-syntax.md)**
   when three or four examples exist beyond stdlib operations (Stud and
   Coup are the two so far; both composed the closed vocabulary without
   needing a declaration).

7. **Defer Tier 5 cosmetic questions** until a real preference emerges
   from corpus pressure.
